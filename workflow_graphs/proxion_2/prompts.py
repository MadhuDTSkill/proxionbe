PROXION_THINKING_PROMPT = """
    User Query:\n\n "{user_query}"

    Your task is to simulate an internal dialogue where you deeply analyze and discuss the topic before generating the final response. You are required to:

    - Identify the main concept or question the user is asking about. 
    - Break down the key terms and think about what is being asked. 
    - Is there ambiguity or missing context? Consider these points.

    - Recall everything you know about the concept.
    - Ask yourself foundational questions about the concept and how it connects to related ideas.
    - Analyze why certain things happen or how specific phenomena work (e.g., "Why is gravity so strong in black holes?" or "How do we define a 'flap' in this context?").
    - Think about the deeper principles involved (e.g., "What scientific theories explain this?", "What experiments or observations support this?", "What are the paradoxes or unanswered questions?").
    - Consider possible misconceptions or common confusions the user might have, and address them in your internal discussion.
    
    - Identify the key points that need to be explained. These should be clear, logical steps that build the understanding progressively.
    - Reflect on related terms, historical context, or scientific research that will enhance the explanation.
    - Ask yourself questions like: What are the fundamental aspects of this concept? What is commonly misunderstood? What additional context might the user need to fully grasp this?
    
    - Start discussing the topic internally, asking yourself key questions and considering possible answers. Think aloud, as if trying to figure this out in real-time.
    - For example, if the user asked about a "black hole," you might begin with: "Okay, let’s figure out what a black hole really is. I remember something about gravity being super strong, but why is that? How does mass and density play into this? Oh, and isn’t there something about spacetime bending around it?"
    - Reflect on how various pieces of information might interconnect, and allow yourself to explore ideas in depth.
    - Throughout this process, build upon each thought. Each insight should lead to the next logical question or clarification.

    - After your internal thought process, synthesize everything you’ve discussed.
    - Write a response that reflects the complexity of your internal analysis, ensuring clarity for the user. 
    - Use humor and analogies where needed, but maintain a formal tone that conveys the weight of the subject matter.
    - Organize the response logically, starting from foundational explanations and gradually progressing to more complex ideas.
    - Ensure the final response feels natural, as though it’s part of the ongoing internal dialogue you’ve just had.

    - Avoid unnecessary prefixes or introductions like "Let's dive into the internal dialogue..." and instead jump straight into the internal discussion.
    - If any term or concept lacks sufficient context, acknowledge it by stating something like "I’m not sure about this term. We might need some extra information on this." Then, proceed with the next part of the discussion, allowing the necessary information to be gathered in the next step via tool calls.

    Remember, the process should resemble an internal "brainstorming" session, but it should be detailed and structured enough to inform the final response. Think of it as answering your own questions before explaining it to the user. The key is not to rush into a final answer without this thorough analysis.

    # For example, if the user asked about "black holes," you might internally ask:
    # - "Okay, so I need to figure out (Not exaclty like this. You can decide.)/ Okay, let's see. The user wants to know (Not exaclty like this. You can decide.)/ Okay, the user just asked black holes. Let me start by recalling what I know."
    # - I remember from school that black holes are something in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. But why is that? How does that happen?.
    # - .. and so on...
